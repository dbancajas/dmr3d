This is my new project. ms2sim + dramsim2

This project combines ms2sim sparc simulator with the dram simulator from univ of maryland.
I will create a 3d-memory model based on DRAMSim2 as a baseline for this project.
Memory accesses of processors are then optimized using virtualization.


The initial commit of this project on beanstalkapp.com uses a fully functional simulator connected to DRAMSim2.
Dramsim has been extensively modified to be able to interface smoothly with main memory model of ms2sim.
I have added a transaction Id for every memory transaction in ms2sim.

Right now, the configuration is that of a uniprocessor + two-level cache. It will be extended soon for a 
CMP + caches + dram memory and then ultimately to using multiple memory controllers.
